Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet


Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:


i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000 iii. Category table = 10000 iv. Checkin table = 10000 v. elite_years table = 10000 vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000 viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000

select count(*) as total from attribute;
+-------+
| total |
+-------+
| 10000 |
+-------+


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, 
please specify which foreign key.


i. Business = id 10000
ii. Hours = business_id 1562
iii. Category = business_id 2643
iv. Attribute = business_id 1115
v. Review = id 10000 business_id 8090 user_id 9581 vi. Checkin = business_id 493
vii. Photo = id 10000 business_id 6493
viii. Tip = business_id 3979 user_id 537 ix. User = id 10000
x. Friend = user_id 11
xi. Elite_years = user_id 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

select count(distinct id)
from business;
+--------------------+
| count(distinct id) |
+--------------------+
|              10000 |
+--------------------+

Copy and Paste the Result Below:
      +-----------------+---------+
      | city            | reviews |
      +-----------------+---------+
      
      
      
6. Find the distribution of star ratings to the business in the following cities:

i. Avon

SQL code used to arrive at answer:

select stars,
sum(review_count)
from business
where city = 'Avon'
group by stars;


ii. Beachwood

SQL code used to arrive at answer:

select stars,
sum(review_count)
from business
where city = 'Beachwood'
group by stars;


7. Find the top 3 users based on their total number of reviews:

SQL code used to arrive at answer:
select name,
sum(review_count)
from user
group by id
order by review_count desc
limit 3;


8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?
Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:

No, because according to result Gerald has more reviews however, Mimi has the most fans.

select name,
fans,
sum(review_count)
from user
group by id
order by review_count desc;


9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them? Answer: There is more reviews with word love than hate.

SQL code used to arrive at answer:

       select count(*) as hate
       from review
       where text like '%hate%';
       
      +------+
      | hate |
      +------+
      |  232 |
      +------+
      
      
      
      select count(*) as love from review
where text like '%love%';


+------+
| love |
+------+
| 1780 |
+------+


10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans: SQL code used to arrive at answer:
select name,
fans
from user
order by fans desc
limit 10;


Part 2: Inferences and Analysis
1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. 
Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours? Yes.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews? Yes

iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
Yes, there is two business in the same neighborhood in different categories with star rates 4-5. And they donâ€™t have much reviews.

SQL code used for analysis:

select
business.name
, business.city
, category.category
, business.stars
, hours.hours
, business.review_count
, business.postal_code
from (business inner join category on business.id = category.business_id)
inner join hours on hours.business_id = category.business_id
where business.city = 'Las Vegas'
group by business.stars;


2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. 
What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? 
List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.

i. Difference 1: The review count for open business is higher than the closed ones. 

ii. Difference 2: The star rates for open business is higher than the closed ones.



SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT avg(stars),
avg(review_count),
is_open
From business
Group By is_open;


3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to 
choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, 
clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business,
predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, 
so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:

i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

Finding a correlation between the total number of businesses with high star rates and the most visited cities.


ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

First I need two different databases to compare businesses in different cities.
Then I have to find the total number of businesses with each star rate. In order to do the analysis, 
I join business and review tables. After that, I add a case statement to easily see the high rates and the low rates.
The reason I choose this analysis is to understand whether the review stars of the businesses in the more visited cities are higher or lower. 
Because when people see that a business is crowded, they tend to give a better rating.


iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:

select city,
count(name) as total_business,
postal_code,
review.stars,
case when review.stars <= 2 then 'low'
when review.stars >= 3 then 'high'
else 'other'
end star_rate
from business
inner join review on business.ID = review.business_ID
group by city
order by total_business desc;
